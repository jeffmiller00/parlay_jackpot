    worst_rationale: A total of 47.5 points in that matchup is ambitious given both teams’ defensive capabilities and recent trend toward lower scoring, making it the least likely of the three bets to hit.

    worst_rationale: The Falcons money-line is the worst bet because Atlanta has been inconsistent and often struggles to win outright, while the Odunze and Robinson yardage props align more closely with their typical performance averages and rely on individual output rather than full team success.

    worst_rationale: If I must pick one as the worst bet this week, I'd pick the combined QB yards (Jackson + McCarthy over 425). The requirement for both to hit high yardage makes it a tougher proposition compared to the others.

      If I must pick one as the “worst bet” this week, I'd pick the Broncos/Texans
      over 40.5 points. The odds are weaker for it relative to the others given the
      potential for a defensive, lower-scoring game.
